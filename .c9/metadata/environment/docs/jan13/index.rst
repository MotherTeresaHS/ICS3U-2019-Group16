This means that you can access and save your code using any text editor. This is particularly helpful in schools, where computers are likely to be locked down so students can not load anything. Also students might be using Chromebooks, where only \"authorized\" Chrome extensions can be loaded.","","If you are working on a Chromebook, the easiest way to start coding is to just use the built in `Text app <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/text/mmfbcljfglbokpmkimbfghdkjmjhdgbg?hl=en>`_. As soon as you open or save a file with a :file:`*.py` extension, it will know it is Python code and automatically start syntax highlighting.","",".. figure:: ./chrome_text_ide.png","    :width: 480 px","    :align: center","    :alt: Chromebook Text Editor","","    Chromebook Text app","","If you are using a non-Chromebook computer, your best beat for an IDE is `Mu <https://codewith.mu>`_. You can get it for Windows, Mac, Raspberry Pi and Linux. It works seamlessly with CircuitPython and the serial console will give you much needed debugging information.

Once you have access to your IDE and you have CircuitPython loaded, you should make sure everything is working before you move on. To do this we will do the traditional \"Hello, World!\" program.

Here is a better version of Hello, World! You will notice that I have a call to a :py:func:`main()` function. This is common in Python code but not normally seen in CircuitPython. I am including it because by breaking the code into different functions to match different scenes, eventually will be really helpful.","","","..
