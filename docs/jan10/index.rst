==================

1. I created an AWS Cognito user pool called "cognitoPool"

2. I used the Cognito built-in signup URL to add myself as a user through my trinity.armstrong@ocsbstudent.ca email. I successfully recieved a link and was confirmed as a user

3. I confirmed that this new user exists in the Cognito pool
