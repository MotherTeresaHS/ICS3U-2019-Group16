================
1. I created a index.html file in the root of my Cloud9. This contains the code for "Hello World!" that I will be using to test my new website once I have connected to Amplify.
2. Next, I pushed all the changes I have made to my github repo in my master terminal. This includes my index.html file.
3. Finally, I connected this instance to Amplify. I did this by going to my dashboard and opening AWS amplify through the services tab. From there, I was able to create my Amplify instance connected to GitHub and deploy my hello world program. I was able to confirm through the provided URL that my code is up and running correctly.
