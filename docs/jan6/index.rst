=================

1. I had created a new Cloud9 in instance in my $70 AWS starter account, I had named it "OverAchiever". This where I can create and edit my code.
2. I connected my GitHub repo (https://github.com/Trinity-Armstrong/ICS3U-2019-Group16) to the root of my new Cloud9 instance. In other words, I had uploaded all the files and images that are stored in my github repo so I can make changes to them.
