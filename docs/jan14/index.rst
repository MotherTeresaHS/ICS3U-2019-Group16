==================

1. I created a javascript folder called "js"

2. I downloaded the JavaScript libraries "amazon-cognito-auth.min", "amazon-cognito-identity.min", "and config.js" into the folder "js"

3. I updated the "config.js" file with my app information from AWS Cognito

4. Typed the code for my sign in page in the file "sign-in.html". This runs 2 input boxes for your email address and password and a sign-in button

5. I signed into my confirmed account and it successfully outputted "You are logged in as: trinity.armstrong@ocsbstudent.ca"
